        I'm a frontend development student at EC Utbildning. I'm passionate about working across the whole stack and care deeply about the human experience behind the tech.<br /><br />
        I fell in love with programming is because it's fun and creative, there is always something new to learn!<br /><br />
        I'm very eager to gain hands-on experience, which is why I'm currently looking for a LIA-internship in Stockholm from November 2025 to May 2026.<br /><br />
